# Cursor Rules for Design Project

## Color Palette
- **ONLY** use these colors in the design:
  - Red (#FF0000, #DC3545, #C82333, #B02A37)
  - Blue (#0000FF, #007BFF, #0056B3, #004085)
  - Black (#000000, #212529, #343A40, #495057)

## Spacing & Layout
- **Wide margins**: Use generous margins throughout the design
  - Minimum 2rem (32px) for small screens
  - Minimum 3rem (48px) for medium screens  
  - Minimum 4rem (64px) for large screens
- Apply wide margins to:
  - Container padding
  - Widget spacing
  - Section separations
  - Content areas

## Design Principles
- Maintain clean, spacious layouts with ample white space
- Use the restricted color palette consistently
- Ensure all elements have proper breathing room
- Prioritize readability through generous spacing

## Implementation Notes
- When creating or modifying HTML/CSS files, strictly adhere to the color restrictions
- Always apply wide margins as the default spacing approach
- Test designs on multiple screen sizes to ensure margin consistency
